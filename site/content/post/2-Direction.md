2 Direction is an exciting casual game for everyday gaming. You have to drive a marble along a zigzag path and collect as many diamonds as you can.

Tap for left and tap for right.  Stay on the lane, do not fall and collect the Diamonds. Challenge yourself to your own high score; if you are a challenge lover you can browse the leaderboard and beat everyone.

There’s only way to survive this game. Keep tapping, and don’t miss a corner.
